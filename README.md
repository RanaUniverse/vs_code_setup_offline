# VS Code Install with My Favourite Settings and so on...

Offline VSIX file download has been stopped from 2025, so i am using my old 2024 December vsix file here.


My Favourite:
    Dragan Color Theme

Python:
    Black Formatter
    Python Debugger
    Python
    Pylance


code_1.96.4-1736991114_amd64.deb: 21 January 2025

This is specially for vs code installation in the my Ubuntu Laptop.

THis will download the vs code deb file and then install this, and then it will configure the settings in it, so that i can get this easily.

The Extensions are not now available to install offline.

```git branch -m main```:- Change Github repo's branch to main.


So from 2025 i need to use the ```./online_vs_code_install.sh``` to install this.
