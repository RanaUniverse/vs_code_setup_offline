# VS Code Install with My Favourite Settings and so on...

This offline installation will install all the extensions i want without asking anything. 3 Python Extension. Dragan Color Theme Extension.





# Last Update Time:

21 May 2025
code_1.100.2-1747260578_amd64.deb


# How i make the Releases

I am now need to change the version number and some information in the [script](./making_release_zip.sh), which i need to run after keeping the code's .deb file.



### ```git clone https://github.com/RanaUniverse/v2```
This can be done like this.


The Last VSIX Files i downloded from the vs code extension tab, by right click and download vsix file.
This all are here Released Version on 1 February 2025

My Favourite:
    Dragan Color Theme

Python:
    Python Debugger
    Python
    Pylance
    Black Formatter


In Online Extensions installed:
```
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension miladfathy.dragan-color-theme
code --install-extension ms-python.black-formatter
```
Because python only will install pylance + debugger + python all 3.


This is specially for vs code installation in the my Ubuntu Laptop.

THis will download the vs code deb file and then install this, and then it will configure the settings in it, so that i can get this easily.

The Extensions are not now available to install offline.

```git branch -m main```:- Change Github repo's branch to main.


To download and isntall latest everything i need to use this repo, [Online VS Code Setup](https://github.com/RanaUniverse/vs_code_setup_by_rana_universe/)

```git clone https://github.com/RanaUniverse/vs_code_setup_by_rana_universe/```
